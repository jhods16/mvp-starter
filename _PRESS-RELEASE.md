There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Harm Reduction Hub 

## Sub-Heading ##
  Harm reduction resources in your community.

## Summary ##
  For folks looking for support: Harm Reduction Hub is your connection point to community services. Find out what resources are available in your area, whether a clinic is accepting patients, and what insurance they take -- without having to make dead-end phone calls or search the fine print.
  
  For community services: Add yourselves to our network! Complete the 'Add a Resource' form to put your services on the map. Add clickable contact info so that people and reach out easily and list the insurance carriers you accept to ensure a smooth admission process.


## Problem ##
  There is no centralized repository of harm reduction resources. Some are on google maps, some are on non profit websites, and some are on clinic websites. On top of that, it is near impossible to get all if the information one might need like: how much does treatment cost? when is a clinic/center open? are they accepting patients? Often the search for support requires an enormous amount of overhead and this is a huge barrier for folks to be safe and get the help they need. Shockingly, there is NO easily accessible information for how to get narcan -- which is a lifesaving drug. 

## Solution ##
  Harm Reduction Hub puts everything in one place! We remove unnecessary barriers to information and support access by displaying services in your area with key-information snapshots. 

## Quote from You ##
  Maximize access, minimize harm.

## How to Get Started ##
  Open the app, look around! Click the nav bar options to filter by service-type or 'Show All' to show all. Click the markers on the map for info snapshots. If you're ready to reach out, click the email or website links! Are you a service looking to post your information? Click the 'Add a Resource' button at the top right and complete the form. Click 'View Map' to navigate back to the map.

## Customer Quote ##
  It's so much work to find a clinic that prescribes Suboxone, accepts my insurance, AND is accepting new patients. Harm Reduction Hub makes it easy!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Harm Reduction shouldn't be hard. Let's break down barriers, open up access-points, and build a community supportive of people in every stage of recovery.
